abstract: However rare, dam breach occurrences are recently reported and
  associated with significant damage to life and property. The rupture of the
  structural dam wall generates severe flow rates that exceed spillway capacity
  consequently generating unprecedented flooding scenarios. The present research
  aims to assess the influence of the dam breach statistical configuration on
  the most relevant parameters to predict the rupture maximum discharge (RMD).
  McBreach© software was used to provide the necessary inputs for the operation
  of the HEC-RAS dam breach module. McBreach© automates the process of batch
  mode simulations providing a Monte Carlo approach to characterize the breach
  parameters stochastically. Thus, a sensitivity analysis was performed to
  identify the most influential breach parameters, followed by an uncertainty
  assessment regarding their statistical definition of the resultant RMD.
  Analysis showed that the overtopping failure mode discharges are most
  sensitive to the breach formation time (tf) parameter, followed by the final
  height breach (Inv) and the final width of the breach (B), which combined are
  responsible for 85% of the rupture’s maximum discharge. Further results
  indicated highly variable RMD magnitudes (up to 300%) depending on the breach
  parameter’s statistical definition (i.e., probability density function and
  associated statistical parameters). The latter significantly impacts the
  estimated flood risk associated with the breach, the flood zone delimitation,
  preparation of emergency action plans (EAP) and scaling of future dam
  projects. Consequently, there is a plausible need for additional
  investigations to reduce this uncertainty and, therefore, the risk associated
  with it.
