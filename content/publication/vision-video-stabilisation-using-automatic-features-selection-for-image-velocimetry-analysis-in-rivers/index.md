abstract: "VISION is open-source software written in MATLAB for video
  stabilisation using automatic features detection. It can be applied for any
  use, but it has been developed mainly for image velocimetry applications in
  rivers. It includes a number of options that can be set depending on the
  user's needs and intended application: 1) selection of different feature
  detection algorithms (seven to be selected with the flexibility to choose two
  simultaneously), 2) definition of the percentual value of the strongest
  features detected to be considered for stabilisation, 3) geometric
  transformation type, 4) definition of a region of interest on which the
  analysis can be performed, and 5) visualisation in real-time of stabilised
  frames. One case study was deemed to illustrate VISION stabilisation
  capabilities on an image velocimetry experiment. In particular, the
  stabilisation impact was quantified in terms of velocity errors with respect
  to field measurements obtaining a significant error reduction of velocities.
  VISION is an easy-to-use software that may support research operating in image
  processing, but it can also be adopted for educational purposes."
