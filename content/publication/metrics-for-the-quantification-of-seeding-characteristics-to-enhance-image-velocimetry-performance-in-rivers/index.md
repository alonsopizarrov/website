abstract: River flow monitoring is essential for many hydraulic and hydrologic
  applications related to water resource management and flood forecasting.
  Currently, unmanned aerial systems (UASs) combined with image velocimetry
  techniques provide a significant low-cost alternative for hydraulic
  monitoring, allowing the estimation of river stream flows and surface flow
  velocities based on video acquisitions. The accuracy of these methods tends to
  be sensitive to several factors, such as the presence of floating materials
  (transiting onto the stream surface), challenging environmental conditions,
  and the choice of a proper experimental setting. In most real-world cases, the
  seeding density is not constant during the acquisition period, so it is not
  unusual for the patterns generated by tracers to have non-uniform
  distribution. As a consequence, these patterns are not easily identifiable and
  are thus not trackable, especially during floods. We aimed to quantify the
  accuracy of particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) and large-scale particle image
  velocimetry (LSPIV) techniques under different hydrological and seeding
  conditions using footage acquired by UASs. With this aim, three metrics were
  adopted to explore the relationship between seeding density, tracer
  characteristics, and their spatial distribution in image velocimetry accuracy.
  The results demonstrate that prior knowledge of seeding characteristics in the
  field can help with the use of these techniques, providing a priori evaluation
  of the quality of the frame sequence for post-processing.
