abstract: The hydrologic sciences and water resources management have long
  depended on a combination of in-situ measurements and remotely-sensed data for
  research and regulatory purposes. In-situ measurements are constrained in
  their spatial distribution by both logistics and costs. Satellite-and manned
  aircraft-based remote sensing provide spatially broad data, but often of a
  coarse resolution. Furthermore, all these data collection methods are often
  limited in their ability to respond to specific short-term events when the
  data and imagery could inform real-time assessment and decision-making,
  especially during and immediately after natural disasters. Researchers and
  regulators are increasingly using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to fill
  these gaps in both spatial and temporal data resolution. UAVs are often more
  cost-effective than traditional remote sensing or in-situ data collection
  methodologies and the availability of new advancements in UAV design, power
  supply, payload capacity, and sensors has been driving rapid innovations in
  their use in the hydrological sciences. This in-depth review explores these
  UAV technologies and how they are being employed for on-demand and
  cost-effective characterization, monitoring, assessment, and modeling of soil
  and water resources. Our discussion addresses both key opportunities and
  challenges in surface water and groundwater studies, land-atmosphere
  interaction studies, water management in agriculture and forestry, ecosystem
  monitoring, and hydrological modeling.
