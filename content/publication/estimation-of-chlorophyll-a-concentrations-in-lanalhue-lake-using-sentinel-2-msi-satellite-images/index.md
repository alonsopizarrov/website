abstract: Inland water is fundamental for the conservation of flora and fauna
  and is a source of drinking water for humans; therefore, monitoring its
  quality and ascertaining its status is essential for making decisions in water
  resources management. As traditional measuring methods present limitations in
  monitoring with high spatial and temporal coverage, using satellite images to
  have greater control over lake observation can be a handy tool and have
  satisfactory results. The study of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) has been widely used
  to ascertain the quality of the inland aquatic environment using remote
  sensing, but in general, it depends on the local conditions of the water body.
  In this study, the suitability of the Sentinel-2 MSI sensor for Chl-a
  estimation in a lake in south-central Chile is tested. An empirical approach
  is proposed, applying multiple linear regressions, comparing the efficiency
  and performance with L1C and L2A products, separating the equations
  constructed with spring-summer and fall-winter data, and restricting Chl-a
  ranges to those measured in the field to generate these regressions. The
  algorithms combining spectral bans proved to have a good correlation with
  Chl-a measured in the field, generally resulting in R2 greater than 0.87 and
  RMSE and MAE with errors less than 6 μg L−1. The spatial distribution of Chl-a
  concentrations at the study site was obtained based on the proposed equations.
