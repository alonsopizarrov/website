abstract: Videos acquired from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) allow for
  monitoring river systems at high spatial and temporal resolutions providing
  unprecedented datasets for hydrological and hydraulic applications. The
  cost-effectiveness of these measurement methods stimulated the diffusion of
  image based frameworks and approaches at scientific and operational levels.
  Moreover, their application in different environmental contexts gives us the
  opportunity to explore their reliability, potentialities and limitations, and
  future perspectives and developments. This paper analyses the recent progress
  on this topic, with a special focus on the main challenges to foster future
  research studies.
