abstract: "River monitoring is of particular interest as a society that faces
  increasingly complex water management issues. Emerging technologies have
  contributed to opening new avenues for improving our monitoring capabilities
  but have also generated new challenges for the harmonised use of devices and
  algorithms. In this context, optical-sensing techniques for stream surface
  flow velocities are strongly influenced by tracer characteristics such as
  seeding density and their spatial distribution. Therefore, a principal
  research goal is the identification of how these properties affect the
  accuracy of such methods. To this aim, numerical simulations were performed to
  consider different levels of tracer clustering, particle colour (in terms of
  greyscale intensity), seeding density, and background noise. Two widely used
  image-velocimetry algorithms were adopted: (i) particle-tracking velocimetry
  (PTV) and (ii) particle image velocimetry (PIV). A descriptor of the seeding
  characteristics (based on seeding density and tracer clustering) was
  introduced based on a newly developed metric called the Seeding Distribution
  Index (SDI). This index can be approximated and used in practice as SDI, where
  ν, ρ, and ρcν1 are the spatial-clustering level, the seeding density, and the
  reference seeding density at ν=1, respectively. A reduction in
  image-velocimetry errors was systematically observed for lower values of the
  SDI; therefore, the optimal frame window (i.e. a subset of the video image
  sequence) was defined as the one that minimises the SDI. In addition to
  numerical analyses, a field case study on the Basento river (located in
  southern Italy) was considered as a proof of concept of the proposed
  framework. Field results corroborated numerical findings, and error reductions
  of about 15.9 % and 16.1 % were calculated – using PTV and PIV, respectively –
  by employing the optimal frame window."
