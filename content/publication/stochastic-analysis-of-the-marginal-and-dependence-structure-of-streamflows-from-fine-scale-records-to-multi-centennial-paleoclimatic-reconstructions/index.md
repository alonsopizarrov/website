abstract: The identification of the second-order dependence structure of
  streamflow has been one of the oldest challenges in hydrological sciences,
  dating back to the pioneering work of H.E Hurst on the Nile River. Since then,
  several large-scale studies have investigated the temporal structure of
  streamflow spanning from the hourly to the climatic scale, covering multiple
  orders of magni-tude. In this study, we expanded this range to almost eight
  orders of magnitude by analysing small-scale streamflow time series (in the
  order of minutes) from ground stations and large-scale streamflow time series
  (in the order of hundreds of years) acquired from paleocli-matic
  reconstructions. We aimed to determine the fractal behaviour and the
  long-range de-pendence behaviour of the streamflow. Additionally, we assessed
  the behaviour of the first four marginal moments of each time series to test
  whether they follow similar behaviours as sug-gested in other studies in the
  literature. The results provide evidence in identifying a common stochastic
  structure for the streamflow process, based on the Pareto–Burr–Feller marginal
  dis-tribution and a generalized Hurst–Kolmogorov (HK) dependence structure.
