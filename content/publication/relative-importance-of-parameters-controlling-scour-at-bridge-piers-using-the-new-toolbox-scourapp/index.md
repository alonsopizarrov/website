abstract: The new toolbox ScourApp is presented and applied for analysis of the
  complex interactions between local scour and sediment deposition at bridges
  during floods and to determine the relative importance of the controlling
  parameters on scour depth. ScourApp represents the time-dependent sediment
  transport processes through modern empirical formulations to compute the
  evolution of scour depth at a bridge pier. Results show that the mathematical
  model reproduces observed scour depths with high accuracy and confirm that
  ScourApp is a suitable tool for scour analysis. The model parameters
  controlling the time-dependent scour depth were the equilibrium scour depth,
  and two constants representing the effects of pier geometry, flow and
  sediment. Sensitivity analysis showed that all three scour model parameters
  exhibited a nearly linear relation with the final scour depth. Moreover,
  results considering sediment deposition obtained for the Rapel Bridge showed
  that scour depths are highly sensitive to the sediment supply rate. ScourApp
  is recommended in scour assessment for bridge planning, design, management,
  and forensic analysis, as well as for engineering education.
