abstract: Inter-basin water transfer projects (IBTs) have significantly
  increased in number in recent decades due to the unremitting need to solve the
  problem of global water imbalance. However, given the complex challenges
  inherent in implementing and maintaining IBTs, there is a need to characterize
  the multi-faceted aspects of sustainability (or unsustainability) that result
  from these megaprojects. Through a systematic review of the literature, we
  sought to identify and characterize the positive and negative impacts that
  most often influence the sustainability of IBTs, focusing on impacts within
  the environmental, social, and economic pillars of sustainability. Based on an
  eligibility criterion, the systematic review selected 68 documents out of an
  initial total of 1567 for information quality analysis and content evaluation.
  The qualitative coding of the documents allowed us to characterize the
  landscape of impacts that result from IBTs across the three pillars of
  sustainability. The study findings revealed that the most frequently coded
  positive impacts related to the environmental pillar of sustainability, while
  the most frequently coded negative impacts related to both social and
  environmental pillars. In addition, the most frequently coded positive impact
  overall related to the economic benefits generated by the IBTs. Through a
  critical analysis of the study findings, we provide an assessment of future
  IBTs with a focus on the UN sustainable development goals.
