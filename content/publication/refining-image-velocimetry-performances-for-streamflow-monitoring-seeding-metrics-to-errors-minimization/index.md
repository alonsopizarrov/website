abstract: "River streamflow monitoring is currently facing a transformation due
  to the emerging of new innovative technologies. Fixed and mobile measuring
  systems are capable of quantifying surface flow velocities and discharges,
  relying on video acquisitions. This camera-gauging framework is sensitive to
  what the camera can “observe” but also to field circumstances such as
  challenging weather conditions, river background transparency, transiting
  seeding characteristics, among others. This short communication paper
  introduces the novel idea of optimizing image velocimetry techniques selecting
  the most informative sequence of frames within the available video. The
  selection of the optimal frame window is based on two reasonable criteria: (a)
  the maximization of the number of frames, subject to (b) the minimization of
  the recently introduced dimensionless seeding distribution index (SDI). SDI
  combines seeding characteristics such as seeding density and spatial
  clustering of tracers, which are used as a proxy to enhance the reliability of
  image velocimetry techniques. Two field case studies were considered as a
  proof-of-concept of the proposed framework, on which seeding metrics were
  estimated and averaged in time to select the proper application window. The
  selected frames were analysed using LSPIV to estimate the surface flow
  velocities and river discharge. Results highlighted that the proposed
  framework might lead to a significant error reduction. In particular, the
  computed discharge errors, at the optimal portion of the footage, were about
  0.40% and 0.12% for each case study, respectively. These values were lower
  than those obtained, considering all frames available."
