abstract: "A novel method is proposed to automatically segment water extent
  using optical data. The key features of this approach are (i) the development
  of a simple physically based model that utilises only RGB data for water
  extent segmentation; (ii) the achievement of high accuracy in the results,
  particularly in the estimation of water surface area and perimeter; (iii) the
  avoidance of any data training process; (iv) the requirement of minimal
  computational resources; and (v) the release of an open-source software
  package that provides both command-line codes and a user-friendly graphical
  interface, making it accessible for various applications, research, and
  educational purposes. The physically based model integrates reflectance of the
  water surface with spectral and quantum interpretation of light. The algorithm
  was tested on 27 rivers and compared to manually-based delimitation, with a
  resulting robust segmentation procedure. Quantified errors were RMSE = 11.91
  (m2) for surface area, RMSE = 12.25 (m) for perimeter, and RMSE in x: 52 (px),
  RMSE in y: 93 (px) for centroid location. Processing time was faster for
  automatic segmentation than manual delimitation, with a time reduction of 40%
  (case-by-case analysis) and 65% (using all case studies together in one run).
  Shadows, light spots, and natural and non-natural elements in the field of
  view may affect the accuracy of results."
