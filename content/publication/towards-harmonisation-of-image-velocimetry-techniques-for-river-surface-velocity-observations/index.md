abstract: Since the turn of the 21st century, image-based velocimetry techniques
  have become an increasingly popular approach for determining open-channel flow
  in a range of hydrological settings across Europe and beyond. Simultaneously,
  a range of large-scale image velocimetry algorithms have been developed that
  are equipped with differing image pre-processing and analytical capabilities.
  Yet in operational hydrometry, these techniques are utilised by few competent
  authorities. Therefore, imagery collected for image velocimetry analysis
  (along with reference data) is required both to enable inter-comparisons
  between these differing approaches and to test their overall efficacy. Through
  benchmarking exercises, it will be possible to assess which approaches are
  best suited for a range of fluvial settings, and to focus future software
  developments. Here we collate and describe datasets acquired from seven
  countries across Europe and North America, consisting of videos that have been
  subjected to a range of pre-processing and image velocimetry analyses (Perks
  et al., 2020,
  https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:014d56f7-06dd-49ad-a48c-2282ab10428e). Reference
  data are available for 12 of the 13 case studies presented, enabling these
  data to be used for reference and accuracy assessment.
