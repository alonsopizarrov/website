abstract: Image-based approaches for surface velocity estimations are becoming
  increasingly popular because of the increasing need for low-cost river flow
  monitoring methods. In this context, seeding characteristics and dynamics
  along the video footage represent one of the key variables influencing image
  velocimetry results. Recent studies highlight the need to identify parameter
  settings based on local flow conditions and environmental factors apriori,
  making the use of image velocimetry approaches hard to automatise for
  continuous monitoring. The seeding distribution index (SDI) – recently
  introduced by the authors – identifies the best frame window length of a video
  to analyse, reducing the computational loads and improving image velocimetry
  performance. In this work, we propose a method based on an average SDI time
  series threshold with noise filtering. This method was tested on three case
  studies in Italy and validated on one in the UK, where a relatively high
  number of measurements was available. Following this method, we observed an
  error reduction of 20–39% with respect to the analysis of the full video. This
  beneficial effect appears even more evident when the optimisation is applied
  at sub-sector scales, in cases where the SDI shows a marked variability along
  the cross-section. Finally, an empirical parameter τ was proposed, calibrated,
  and validated for practical uses to define the SDI threshold. τ showed
  relatively stable values in the different contexts where it has been applied.
  Application of the seeding index to image-based velocimetry for surface flow
  velocity estimates is likely to enhance measurement accuracy in future
  studies.
