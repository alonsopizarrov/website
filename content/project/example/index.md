Environmental monitoring plays a central role for the management of natural and agricultural systems. On this context, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are radically evolving offering an extraordinary opportunity to bridge the existing gap between field observations and traditional air - and space - borne remote sensing.\
A network of scientists is currently cooperating within the framework of a COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action named “Harmonious”. Our intention is to promote monitoring strategies, establish harmonized monitoring practices, and transfer most recent advances on UAS methodologies to others within a global network.
