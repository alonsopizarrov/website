summary: "The Forensic Local scOur assessment fOr briDge resilience (FLOOD
  RESILIENCE) project aims to develop a novel and comprehensive probabilistic
  framework for evaluating bridge scour risk. Although scour is the leading
  cause of bridge failures worldwide, the current practices for bridge scour
  risk management are quite inefficient (they are often based on expensive,
  potentially inaccurate, and time-consuming visual inspections). Moreover,
  current scour risk assessment procedures do not allow an explicit
  quantification of the expected direct and indirect losses due to the
  occurrence of multiple future floods with different intensities. The latter
  motivated the Principal Investigator (PI) to follow a numerical and modelling
  approach to deal with and overcome the limitations of current bridge scour
  risk procedures. FLOOD RESILIENCE  will adopt 3 working packages related to:
  a) Stochastic processes in hydrology (floods and synthetic generation of
  streamflow timeseries); b) Hydraulic analysis (scour timeseries and scour
  hazard model); c) Structural analysis (scour vulnerability model and scour
  risk)."

    of streamflow time-series will be performed with the intention of
    reproducing and generating synthetic data to compute the scour depth

    modelling strategy for bridge vulnerability assessment that relies on
    nonlinear structural analysis of different bridge typologies subjected to
    scour (objective 2). In consequence, numerical modelling will be performed.
    Considering different bridge typologies will allow the exportation of
    project results to other bridges in Chile and worldwide (i.e., impacting not
    only the selected case studies but also the entire infrastructure network).
    WP3 will consider results from WP1 and WP2 to develop a probabilistic
    methodology to estimate the current and future risk of bridge collapse due
    to scour (objective 3). The risk will be computed considering the three
    basic components: hazard, vulnerability, and exposure. Future risks of
    bridge collapse will consider the effects of climate variability on
    hydraulic loads through different possible scenarios and Monte Carlo
    simulations. This novel methodology will account for both the erosional and
    refilling part of the scour process."
